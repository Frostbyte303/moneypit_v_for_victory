I place all this code in the public domain. I claim no responsibility for the 
correctness of the code -- in fact, it does have bugs, and should not be used 
in any kinds of systems where money, lives, animals, or anything else you 
care about are at stake. You take full responsibility for whatever you manage 
to do (or, more likely, fail to do) using this code.

Parts of the code are based on Broadcom code (RaspiVid.c) and the STB library 
and I claim no copyright or change in license for those parts; those parts 
are just re-distributed under the terms of those separate licenses. Using the 
code implies that you agree to those licenses.
